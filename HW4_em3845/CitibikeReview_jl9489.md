 # Citibike Test for Subscriber vs. Non-Subscriber
 
 This is a really interesting test, and something that I would not have thought of.  It may help to know how many different user types there are.  This will help with narrowing the question, and the data wrangling.  If it is just "Customer" and "Subscriber" then your idea might alter a little.  It might also help to use more months, to see trends.
 
 Idea: More Citibike users register as "Subscriber" than "Customer" when they are consistently going to work (ie: weekdays during non-summer months), which increases the amount of consistent bicyclists the tri-state area.
 
 Null Hypothesis: During weekdays, the percentage of users who register as "Subscriber" is lower or equal to the percentage of users who register as "Customer". Alpha = 0.05
 
 Alternative Hypothesis: During weekdays, the percentage of users who register as "Subscriber" is higher than the percentage of users who register as "Customer". Alpha = 0.05
 
 I would suggest using a t-test to run this comparison, in order to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the percentages for "Subscriber" usage and "Customer" usage.
